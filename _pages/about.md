I am a fourth-year [Engineering Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcPO4yhWSUg&t=33s) (Machine Intelligence) student at the University of Toronto. My research sits at the intersection of **natural language processing**, **information retrieval**, and **human-AI interaction**.

My research focuses on building **human-centered AI systems** that leverage natural language processing and information retrieval to assist, enhance, and accelerate human activities. I'm particularly interested in how structured systems design can help make AI tools more reliable and aligned with actual user needs.

Currently, I'm working with Professor [Tovi Grossman](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~tovi/) on building a proactive learning system that leverages rich information from users' daily interactions. The system anticipates what learners need and surfaces relevant information before they ask, exemplifying my approach of installing structure while maintaining accountability to actual user behavior.

I'm also exploring causal reasoning in LLMs with Professor [Zhijing Jin](https://zhijing-jin.com/fantasy/) at the Vector Institute, investigating how causal inference can improve LLM reliability and interpretability.

My work with Professor [Scott Sanner](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/) resulted in one of the first LLM-powered retrieval-augmented conversational recommender systems. The key insight was to install structure in both the system and the data: we used a semi-structured natural language state tracking framework to maintain conversational context, while grounding recommendations in factual item databases and user reviews. This approach balances the LLM's natural language generation capabilities with the reliability of structured retrieval, published at SIGIR 2024. More recently, we've been working on elaborative query reformulation techniques that transform underspecified natural language queries into more effective retrieval requests, making recommendation systems more robust to how users actually express their needs (arXiv 2025).

I also explored applying score-based generative models to abstract reasoning problems with Professor [Alán Aspuru-Guzik](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/basic-content-page/about-alan).
