I am a fourth-year [Engineering Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcPO4yhWSUg&t=33s) (Machine Intelligence) student at the University of Toronto. My research focuses on **human-AI interaction**.

I'm interested in building intelligent, fluid interfaces that augment human workflow rather than replace it—supporting complex and creative tasks through systems that enhance rather than automate human capabilities.

Currently, I'm working with Professor [Tovi Grossman](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~tovi/) on **LOOM**, a proactive learning system that builds personalized knowledge graphs from user interactions. We are continuing to develop visualizations that help users see how concepts connect and identify gaps in their understanding.

Previously, I worked with Professor [Scott Sanner](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/) on retrieval-augmented conversational recommendation (SIGIR 2024), grounding LLM recommendations in structured data and user reviews. I also explored causal reasoning in LLMs with Professor [Zhijing Jin](https://zhijing-jin.com/fantasy/) at the Vector Institute and score-based generative models with Professor [Alán Aspuru-Guzik](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/basic-content-page/about-alan).
